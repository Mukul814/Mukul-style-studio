# Mukul Style Studio 💇‍♂️💈

This is a front-end design for a hair styling salon website. I built it for a digital assignemnt for the subject Modern Web Application under the faculty: Dr. Ramesh C VIT Vellore.

## What this project does

It shows how a salon's website could look — with sections like services, about us, and contact.
## Why I made this

I wanted to try building a salon-style layout from scratch, without using any pre-made templates. It helped me improve my web design and styling skills using Tailwind.

## How to run it

1. First, install the necessary packages:
```bash
npm install
