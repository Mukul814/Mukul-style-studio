# Mukul Style Studio 💇‍♂️💈

This is a front-end design for a hair styling salon website.

## What this project does

It shows how a salon's website should look — with sections like services, about us, and contact.

## Why I made this

I wanted to practically implement my HTML,CSS to try building a salon-style layout from scratch, without using any pre-made templates. It helped me improve my web design and styling skills using Tailwind.
